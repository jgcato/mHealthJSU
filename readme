mHealthJSU OBJECTIVE: 
The project seeks to champion strong mental health among injured student-athletes to help them during recovery by providing information, resources, and encouragement through an application. We believe that the project will have a positive impact on students' mental health and give them an opportunity to concentrate on their academics and recovery.
